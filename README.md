# Webpack Express Example App

The goal of this repo is be an example of a basic but functional app built on Express and Webpack.

If you are just starting this process, start from branch 0-initial-setup. Otherwise, switch to the appropriate numbered branches of this repo as needed. The branches are:
- [0-initial-setup](https://github.com/udacity/fend-webpack-content/tree/0-initial-setup)
- [1-install-webpack](https://github.com/udacity/fend-webpack-content/tree/1-install-webpack)
- [2-add-webpack-entry](https://github.com/udacity/fend-webpack-content/tree/2-add-webpack-entry)
- [3-webpack-output-and-loaders](https://github.com/udacity/fend-webpack-content/tree/3-webpack-output-and-loaders)
- [4-webpack-plugins](https://github.com/udacity/fend-webpack-content/tree/4-webpack-plugins)
- [5-webpack-mode](https://github.com/udacity/fend-webpack-content/tree/5-webpack-mode)
- [6-webpack-for-convenience](https://github.com/udacity/fend-webpack-content/tree/6-webpack-for-convenience)

Each branch in this project is a step along the path to creating a fully functional webpack setup. In each branch, there will be a documentation file that lists out the steps taken in that branch (each step is also roughly a git commit if you look at the history) which you can use as a checklist when setting up your own projects. 

## What we will cover

We will cover:

- Webpack entry point
- Webpack output and dist folder
- Webpack Loaders
- Webpack Plugins
- Webpack Mode
- Tools for convenient Webpack development
