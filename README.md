# Webbpack Express Example App

The goal of this repo is be an example of a basic but functional app built on Express and Webpack.

If you want to follow along with the course, you will start from the master and switch to the appropriate numbered branches of this repo as needed. The branches are:
- [0-initial-setup](https://github.com/udacity/fend-webpack-content/tree/0-initial-setup)
- [1-install-webpack](https://github.com/udacity/fend-webpack-content/tree/1-install-webpack)
- [2-add-webpack-entry](https://github.com/udacity/fend-webpack-content/tree/2-add-webpack-entry)
- [3-webpack-output-and-loaders](https://github.com/udacity/fend-webpack-content/tree/3-webpack-output-and-loaders)
- [4-webpack-plugins](https://github.com/udacity/fend-webpack-content/tree/4-webpack-plugins)
- [5-webpack-mode](https://github.com/udacity/fend-webpack-content/tree/5-webpack-mode)
- [6-webpack-for-convenience](https://github.com/udacity/fend-webpack-content/tree/6-webpack-for-convenience)

Each one is a step along the path to creating a fully functional webpack setup. In each branch, there will be a documentation file that lists out the steps taken in that branch (each step should also match to a git commit if you look at the history) which you can use as a checklist when setting up your own projects.
